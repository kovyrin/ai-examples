# Project Overview

The Language SRS Sidekick is a Rails application for building and maintaining vocabulary-building and grammar-focused SRS (Anki) decks.

## Core Concepts
- **Queue Processing**: Words/phrases added to a queue from different **Vocabulary Sources**, then converted into **Vocabulary Notes** with LLM assistance.
- **Vocabulary Notes**: SRS notes with attributes like content, translations, part-of-speech, examples, and audio
- **Vocabulary Sources**: Manual input and LingQ API integration
- **SRS Syncing**: Synchronization of **Vocabulary Notes** with Anki

## Technology Stack
- Ruby on Rails with SQLite
- Tailwind CSS and Hotwire
- ActiveStorage for audio files
- OpenAI API for LLM assistance, note generation, etc
- Anki Connect for Anki integration, see [500-anki-connect.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/500-anki-connect.mdc) for details

### Audio Generation
- Content (word/sentence) and example sentence audio generated via Google TTS API
- Audio files stored using ActiveStorage

### LLM Integration
- OpenAI API used for content enrichment
- Custom wrapper for the API client to keep prompts organized and easy to iterate on
- See [500-llm-actions.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/500-llm-actions.mdc) for more detail

See [README.md](mdc:README.md) for detailed information about the application.
See [docs/data_model.md](mdc:docs/data_model.md) for data model documentation.

You can refer to the `docs/features` directory for information on the implementation of specific features in the app.
